\section{Conclusion}

This project investigated quadruped locomotion using both classical CPG-based control and deep reinforcement learning. CPGs combined with Cartesian PD control enabled stable and efficient locomotion across a wide speed range. Reinforcement learning further improved adaptability by modulating CPG parameters, producing smooth and robust behaviors.

The results demonstrate that combining biologically inspired structure with learning-based optimization yields controllers that are both stable and flexible. Future work includes extending the framework to turning, gait transitions, and real-world deployment through more extensive domain randomization and hardware-aware modeling.
